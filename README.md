# Flow-cytometry-tools
Is a repository from the Yeast group at Applied Microbiology, Lund University, Sweden.

The code found in this repository was used to process the data from the paper [Brink et al (2016)](https://microbialcellfactories.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12934-016-0580-x). 

At the moment, this repository contains the following tools for flow cytometry data analysis:

                 FI_size_normalization_loader
is a custom initiation script for the Knijnenburg morphology correction model for flow cytometry data.
This script enables automated high-throughput data analysis of .fcs files by calling said correction model,
extracting the normalized data and performing calculations on the geometrical mean of the histograms on the
FL1-H channel (can be modified to assess also other channels).

                 batch_name_change_accuri_fc_data
is a Python3 script for automized batch renaming of .fcs files generated by the BD Accuri C6 software.
The script has been co-designed with the Matlab script FI_size_normalization_loader.m, and the Python script 
can therefore output the renamed files in the directory hierachy required by the Matlab script.
