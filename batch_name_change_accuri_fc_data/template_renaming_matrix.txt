#
# The required format is 'POS: <desired filename>',
# where POS is the name of the well: the first character is a letter A-H,
# the second character is 0 if the well number is <10
# if well number is >=10, the the number occupies character two and three,
# The POS tag must end with a colon (:)
# Example: Well in position row C, column 5 will have POS 'C05:'
#
# NB! It is important that all names for the wells are unique, otherwise the files will be overwritten
#
# Lines that starts with hashtags (#) will not be read by the script 


## Path to files to be renamed (NB! keep 'PATH=')##
PATH=/home/my_fcs_data/2016-01-28 samples/0h


## Path where you want the renamed files to be stored (NB! keep 'NEWPATH'. Leave blank to keep them in the same folder)##
NEWPATH=/home/my_fcs_data/2016-01-28 samples/renamed



## The tags MAIN_DIR, SUBDIR and SUB_SUBDIR can be used if the files should be stored in sub and subsub directories inside NEWPATH (or PATH if NEWPATH is left blank) ##
# NB! these tags must also be in the well names below

MAIN_DIR=strain1
MAIN_DIR=strain2

SUBDIR=bio-rep1
SUBDIR=bio-rep2
#SUBDIR=blanks

SUB_SUBDIR=glucose1g-l
SUB_SUBDIR=glucose20g-l
